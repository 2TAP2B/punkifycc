## Why PUNKIFY?

Hey there! I'm Tobias, and this is **PUNKIFY** - basically my answer to being fed up with Spotify.

After 20+ years of collecting music (yeah, I'm that guy with boxes of cassettes and Vinyls), I got tired of algorithms telling me what to listen to. So I built my own streaming service.

This isn't some grand plan to take down Spotify. It's just me figuring out how to organize my massive music collection and stream it properly. Turns out, when you've got rare 80s music that never made it to Spotify mixed with bootlegs and digital files, you need something that actually gets it.

I'm sharing how I did it because maybe you're sick of the mainstream stuff too. Or maybe you just want to see how to build your own music streaming setup. Either way, welcome to the journey.
